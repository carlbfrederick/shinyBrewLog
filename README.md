# shinyBrewLog

This package contains an app that will facilitate analyzing process data from
brew day/fermentation. It is meant to be complementary to the existing recipe
software like BeerSmith, Brewer's Friend, etc.  

Key (planned) functionality includes:

  - import recipe info from BeerXML files
  - a shiny app to track process measurements (temps, volumes, specific gravity, ...)
  - canned functions to look at key metrics over time (efficiency)
  - ???
